                    <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1>
                    <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
                        Orleans.
                        Celebrations
                        are
                        concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
                        Wednesday . Usually there is one major parade each day; many
                        days
                        have
                        several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days
                        of the Mardi
                        Gras
                        season.

                        The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the
                        same parade
                        schedule and
                        route
                        each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest,
                        Rex, the
                        Knights
                        of Momus
                        and
                        the Krewe of Proteus.
                        While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                        originate
                        in
                        the Uptown
                        and
                        Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
                        upriver side of
                        the
                        French
                        Quarter.</p>
                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the
                        Mississippi
                        River in what is now
                        lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                        celebrated it as part of an
                        observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New
                        Orleans is unknown. A 1730
                        account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming
                        (including cross-dressing).
                        Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls
                        was
                        already established.
                        Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were
                        sometimes
                        prohibited by law, and
                        were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                        In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent
                        raised money to fund an
                        official Mardi Gras celebration.</p>

                    <p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
                        politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                        Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
                        Before becoming mayor, Cantrell
                        represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.

                    <h1>Costumes and masks</h1>
                    <p>In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days
                        before Fat Tuesday (other
                        than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's
                        identity with a mask are
                        suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security
                        concerns (such as
                        convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.</p>

                    <p>Mardi Gras Day is March 1 2022. Fat Tuesday is the last day of the Carnival season as it
